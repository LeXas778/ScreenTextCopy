# TextCopier
 
A simple python program for windows that screenshots an area of the screen and outputs it as text in the console. 

To use, just download the .exe file in the 'dist' folder.
.exe was build using pyinstaller

## Usage
Window needs to be in focus. Place it so the text you want to copy is not hidden by the window. Now you can mark twoo points with your mouse, and the program will try to read the text inside of the area between the two points.

`CTRL + SHIFT + A` to mark a point. Hold the mouse still for few seconds to get best results; sometimes it might capture the point a little late.
Output can be seen in the console.
